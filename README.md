# Snake Game

## Overview
The Snake game is a classic arcade game where the player controls a snake that grows as it eats apples. The objective is to score as many points as possible by eating apples while avoiding collisions with the walls or the snake's own body.

## Features
1. **Simple and intuitive gameplay**: Control the snake using the arrow keys.
2. **Dynamic Apple Generation**: Apples are randomly placed on the screen after being eaten.
3. **Self-Collision Detection**: The game ends if the snake collides with itself or the screen boundaries.
4. **Score Display**: The current score is displayed in the top-left corner of the screen.
5. **Game Over Screen**: Option to restart or quit after losing.
6. **Adjustable Game Speed**: Control snake speed via frame rate to increase or decrease difficulty.
7. **Keyboard Input**: Easily control the snake's direction with the arrow keys.

## Technical Details

### Dependencies
- **Pygame**: A set of Python modules designed for writing video games. It is required for handling graphics, sound, and input.
  
### Installation Instructions
1. **Install Pygame**:
   Install the `pygame` library using pip:
   ```bash
   pip install pygame
   ```

2. **Run the game**:
   Run the game script using the following command:
   ```bash
   python snake.py
   ```

### Game Loop
The core of the game is managed by the game loop, which handles:
- **User input**: Keyboard inputs to control the snake's direction.
- **Game state updates**: The snake’s movement, apple consumption, score tracking, and collision detection.
- **Rendering**: Continuously updates the screen with the snake’s new position, apple position, and current score.

The loop runs until the player closes the window or the snake collides with itself or the wall.

## Controls
- **Arrow keys**: Use the arrow keys to change the snake's direction (Up, Down, Left, Right).

## How to Play
1. Use the arrow keys to control the snake.
2. Eat apples to grow the snake and increase your score.
3. Avoid colliding with the walls or the snake's body.
4. If the snake collides with itself or the walls, the game ends. You will have the option to restart by pressing 'R' or quit by pressing 'Q'.
